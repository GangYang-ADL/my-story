# Goal

Going to deploy a personal website from 0 to 1.
Inspired by Andrew Borstein.

# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Using Vue 3 as the front-end framework to init this project.

# Tailwind CSS + Flowbite

Headless UI is a set of entirely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS.  
However, [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) has more UI components ready to be used than [headless UI](https://headlessui.com/).
